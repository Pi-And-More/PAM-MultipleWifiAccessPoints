# PAM-MultipleWifiAccessPoints

Arduino IDE code to allow your ESP8266 to select the correct wifi to connect to based on a list of credentials you have.

Sometimes you want your IoT project to be mobile. You carry it around with you for example and there are multiple access points it can connect to. This code allows you to save multiple wifi access points and based on availability of an SSID in a network scan, the ESP will connect to it.
